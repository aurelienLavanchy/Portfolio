# Portfolio

My personal portfolio, it should contain all the projects I have worked on (separated by training).

## Deployment

Since I'm using a standard ("vanilla") *HTML* - *CSS* - *Javascript* setup, I opted for **Github Pages**. Any push to the main branch (`trunk`) triggers a new deployment automatically.

> You can find the deployed site [here](https://aurelienlavanchy.github.io/Portfolio)
